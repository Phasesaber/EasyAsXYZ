Learn how to code in various languages in no time at all!

The site uses the Ace editor (http://ace.c9.io/ Which GitHub uses as well) to display the code, and jQuery (http://jquery.org/) to read the files.

All of the files are kept in the /docs/ folder, with their appropriate file extensions, so you can compile and test them for yourself!
